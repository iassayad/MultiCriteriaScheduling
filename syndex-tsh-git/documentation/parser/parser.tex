\chapter{Application specification}
Produce this chapter with automatic translator. For instance, use y2l
(should find download easily):
./y2l -O2 sdx\_parser.mly > parser.tex

You will just have to delete \%type and \%start which seem to be OCaml
extensions.

Check that all went good (rarely, some rules are erroneous) and add a
few sections to make it clearer.
