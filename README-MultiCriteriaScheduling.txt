This Web Page contains 5 source code directories and a readme file :

1 - syndex-tsh-git directory 
----------------------------
Three criteria scheduling heuristics (TSH) : a heuristics for power, latency and execution time optimization. It is developed in Syndex.

2 - MILP-optimal-tsh-nocoms-git
------------------------------
Optimal three criteria scheduling algorithm : a MILP program for power, latency and execution time optimization. It is developed using IBM CPLEX optimizer. It does not take into account communication costs.


3 - MILP-optimal-tsh-coms-git
----------------------------- 
Optimal three criteria scheduling algorithm : a MILP program for power, latency and execution time optimization. It is developed using IBM CPLEX optimizer.


4 - MILP-optimal-adaptive-git
-----------------------------
Adaptive throughput and power scheduling for a dynamic set of applications. It is developed using an optimal MILP program for the off-line part where individual application pareto-fronts are generated; and developed in Java for the on-line mapping heuristic part. This directory contains the off-line part. 

5 - Adaptive-Mapping-git
-------------------------
Adaptive throughput and power scheduling for a dynamic set of applications. It is developed in Java for the on-line mapping part and developed using an optimal MILP program for the off-line part where individual application pareto-fronts are generated.  This directory contains the on-line part.
